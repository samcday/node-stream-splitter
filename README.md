# stream-splitter `0.1.0`

Split them streams, in style!

```javascript
var fs = require("fs");
var StreamSplitter = require("stream-splitter");

var splitter = fs.createReadStream("afile.txt").pipe(StreamSplitter("\n"));

// Set encoding on the splitter Stream, so tokens come back as a String.
splitter.encoding = "utf8";

splitter.on("token", function(token) {
	console.log("A line of input:", token);
});

splitter.on("done", function() {
	console.log("And that's all folks!");
});

splitter.on("error", function(err) {
	// Any errors that occur on a source stream will be emitted on the 
	// splitter Stream, if the source stream is piped into the splitter 
	// Stream, and if the source stream doesn't have any other error
	// handlers registered.
	console.error("Oh noes!", err);
});
```

## Installation

`npm install stream-splitter`

## API

```javascript
StreamSplitter = require("stream-splitter")
```

`StreamSplitter` accepts a single argument, and returns a `WritableStream`:

```javascript
	aWritableStream = StreamSplitter(token);
```

## Usage

See the example above. Some notes:

* The WritableStream returned will sense if you pipe a stream into it, and will 
register an error handler on the source stream. If an error occurs on the source
stream and you don't have any other handlers registered, the returned 
WritableStream will emit the source stream `error` for you. This enables you to
chain a newly created ReadableStream straight into a StreamSplitter.
* The emitted tokens will be `Buffer`s unless you set the splitter Stream 
`encoding` field.
* This lib is designed to be as efficient as possible, making use of 
substack/node-buffers library to avoid unnecessary `Buffer` allocations/copies.
